### Distributed Lab Challenge

Thank you very much for preparing such interesting and diverse tasks! It was very interesting to learn new technologies and apply them in practice!

Unfortunately I practically didn't put any comments in the code, so I tried to detail the solutions in README and also I
used `std` and `bits/stdc++.h` in c++ code :((

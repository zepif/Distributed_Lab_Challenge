# The Longest UTXO chain

This is a Python application that explores and analyzes a simulated Bitcoin blockchain.
I had a problem with block parsing, so I made a basic implementation from scratch. The main components of the blockchain were implemented: including blocks, transactions, UTXO, validation, finding the longest valid chain and transaction filtering. 

### Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
`https://github.com/zepif/Distributed_Lab_Challenge.git

cd 'Task #6. Longest UTXO chain'
```

Then you need to install all necessary requirements:


```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

To run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Time Spent

I spent about a day solving this problem
